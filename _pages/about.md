I am a final-year BT-MT Dual Degree student at IIT Kanpur. My current research is based on some miscellaneous theoretical problems involving functions and sets in general and signal processors in particular. I have also worked in the fields of Human-Centered Computing during an internship at <a href="https://www.ufl.edu/">University of Florida</a> and in Image Processing at IIT Kanpur.

Topics that intrigue me include, but are not limited to, puzzles, algorithms, innovations, research problems or any social/public policy.
