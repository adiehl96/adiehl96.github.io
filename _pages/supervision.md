#### Currently accepting students (Bachelor or Master)
If you'd like to do your thesis project with me as a supervisor, feel free to reach out to me ([contact](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/diehl-a)).

#### Thesis Project on Neuromorphic Computing
You might be interested in working on this project if you find some of the following things interesting:
- What exactly is computation?
- How can we formalise the notion of computation for systems that aren't traditional computers?
- Can we prove that one system always needs less energy for a certain computation than another system?
- How has the field of computer science treated energy complexity historically speaking?
- How do different models of computation relate to one another?
- Can we formalise the idea that two models of computation might need to work together to solve a problem?
- Do different neuron models show different levels of computational power?
- How do computers do math?
  - How do spiking neural networks do math?
